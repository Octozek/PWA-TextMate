# J.A.T.E - Just Another Text Editor

## Description

J.A.T.E is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser. This single-page application meets PWA criteria and features multiple data persistence techniques, ensuring reliable functionality offline. Built using Webpack, Babel, IndexedDB, and Workbox, this project demonstrates modern web development practices.

## Features

- **IndexedDB**: For storing and retrieving text editor content.
- **Service Worker**: Using Workbox to cache static assets for offline use.
- **Babel**: For transpiling next-gen JavaScript.
- **Webpack**: For bundling JavaScript files.
- **PWA**: Installable as a Progressive Web Application with a manifest file.
